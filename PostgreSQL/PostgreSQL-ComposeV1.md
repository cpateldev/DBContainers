# Docker Compose Configuration: PostgreSQL with Adminer & Bind Mount

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `PostGreSQLWithNamedVol-Compose.yml` Docker Compose file. This configuration sets up a PostgreSQL database service along with an Adminer web interface for database management, using a specific host directory as persistent storage for PostgreSQL data via a bind mount configured as a named volume.

## File Overview

*   **File Name:** `PostGreSQLWithNamedVol-Compose.yml`
*   **Purpose:** To define and run a multi-container Docker application consisting of a PostgreSQL database and an Adminer database management tool.
*   **Key Feature:** Uses a bind mount (configured within the `volumes` section) to persist PostgreSQL data to a specific directory on the host machine (`D:\Docker_Shared\PostgreSQLDev`).

## Prerequisites

*   Docker installed and running.
*   Docker Compose installed (usually included with Docker Desktop).
*   The host directory `D:\Docker_Shared\PostgreSQLDev` must exist or be creatable by Docker. **Note:** This path is specific to a Windows environment.

## How to Run

To start the services defined in this file, navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
docker compose -f PostGreSQLWithNamedVol-Compose.yml up -d
```

*   `docker compose`: Invokes the Docker Compose tool.
*   `-f PostGreSQLWithNamedVol-Compose.yml`: Specifies the configuration file name.
*   `up`: Creates and starts the containers.
*   `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

## Configuration Breakdown

```yaml
# Run following command to run this container.
# docker compose -f PostGreSQLWithNamedVol-Compose.yml up -d
version: "3.8"                    # Specifies the Docker Compose file format version.
name: postgresqlcompose           # Defines a custom project name. Default is the directory name.

services:                         # Defines the containers (services) to be run.

  postgresqldb:                   # Logical name for the PostgreSQL service within Compose.

    environment:                  # Sets environment variables inside the container.
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres    # Sets the default superuser username for PostgreSQL.
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres # Sets the password for the default superuser. **SECURITY WARNING:** Use strong passwords in production!
    ports:                        # Maps ports between the host machine and the container (HOST:CONTAINER).
      - "5432:5432"               # Maps host port 5432 to container port 5432 (standard PostgreSQL port).
    volumes:                      # Mounts volumes for data persistence.
      - nvPostGreSQL:/var/lib/postgresql/data # Mounts the volume named 'nvPostGreSQL' to the default PostgreSQL data directory inside the container.

  adminer:                        # Logical name for the Adminer service within Compose.
    image: adminer                # Specifies the Docker image to use (official Adminer image from Docker Hub).
    container_name: adminerUI     # Explicit name for the running container.
    restart: always               # Policy to automatically restart the container if it stops.
    ports:                        # Maps ports between the host machine and the container.
      - 8080:8080                 # Maps host port 8080 to container port 8080 (default Adminer port).

volumes:                          # Defines named volumes used by the services.
  nvPostGreSQL:                   # Defines a volume named 'nvPostGreSQL'.
    driver: local                 # Specifies the volume driver. 'local' is the default and uses the host filesystem.
    driver_opts:                  # Provides options specific to the 'local' driver.
      type: none                  # Often used with 'bind' option to indicate no specific filesystem type.
      device: D:\Docker_Shared\PostgreSQLDev # **IMPORTANT:** Specifies the *host path* to bind mount. This makes it a BIND MOUNT, not a Docker-managed volume.
      o: bind                     # Specifies the mount operation type as 'bind'.
```

### Top-Level Keys

*   `version: "3.8"`: Declares the version of the Docker Compose file syntax being used. Version 3.8 is a stable and widely compatible version.
*   `name: postgresqlcompose`: Sets a specific name for the Docker Compose project (stack). If omitted, Docker Compose typically uses the name of the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file. This name will be used as a prefix for containers, networks, and volumes created by this stack unless explicitly overridden (like with `container_name`).

### `services` Section

This section defines the individual application components (containers).

1.  **`postgresqldb` Service:**
    *   `container_name: postgresdev2`: Assigns a specific, fixed name (`postgresdev2`) to the container created for this service. Without this, Compose would generate a name like `postgresqlcompose_postgresqldb_1`.
    *   `image: postgres`: Pulls and uses the official `postgres` image (latest tag by default) from Docker Hub.
    *   `restart: always`: Ensures that if the `postgresdev2` container stops for any reason (error, system reboot), Docker will automatically attempt to restart it.
    *   `environment`: Sets environment variables required by the `postgres` image on its first run:
        *   `POSTGRES_USER=postgres`: Creates a PostgreSQL superuser named `postgres`.
        *   `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres`: Sets the password for the `postgres` user. **Warning:** These are insecure default credentials, suitable only for local development. Change them for any sensitive environment.
    *   `ports`: Exposes the PostgreSQL service to the host machine.
        *   `"5432:5432"`: Maps port 5432 on the host machine to port 5432 inside the `postgresdev2` container. This allows database clients on the host (or other machines that can reach the host) to connect to PostgreSQL using `host_ip:5432`.
    *   `volumes`: Defines how data is persisted for this service.
        *   `nvPostGreSQL:/var/lib/postgresql/data`: Mounts the volume defined under the top-level `volumes:` key named `nvPostGreSQL` to the path `/var/lib/postgresql/data` inside the container. This is the standard location where PostgreSQL stores its database files. This ensures that database data persists even if the container is removed and recreated.

2.  **`adminer` Service:**
    *   `image: adminer`: Pulls and uses the official `adminer` image (latest tag by default) from Docker Hub. Adminer is a lightweight web-based database management tool.
    *   `container_name: adminerUI`: Assigns the specific name `adminerUI` to the container created for this service.
    *   `restart: always`: Ensures the Adminer container restarts automatically if it stops.
    *   `ports`: Exposes the Adminer web interface.
        *   `8080:8080`: Maps port 8080 on the host machine to port 8080 inside the `adminerUI` container. You can access the Adminer interface by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host_ip:8080` in your web browser.

### `volumes` Section

This section defines named volumes that can be referenced by services.

*   **`nvPostGreSQL` Volume:**
    *   This defines a volume named `nvPostGreSQL`. However, the `driver_opts` configure it to behave as a **bind mount**.
    *   `driver: local`: Specifies that the volume uses the local host filesystem driver.
    *   `driver_opts`: Provides specific configuration for the `local` driver:
        *   `type: none`: Typically used in conjunction with `o: bind`.
        *   `device: D:\Docker_Shared\PostgreSQLDev`: **Crucially**, this specifies the exact path on the *host machine* (`D:\Docker_Shared\PostgreSQLDev`) that will be mounted into the container. Docker will mount the contents of this host directory into the target path specified in the service's volume definition (`/var/lib/postgresql/data`). **This path is specific to the host environment (Windows in this case) and makes the setup less portable.**
        *   `o: bind`: Explicitly tells the driver to perform a bind mount operation.

#### Named Volume vs. Bind Mount (in this context)

*   **True Named Volume (without `driver_opts` specifying a device):** Docker manages the volume's storage location on the host (usually within `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` on Linux). This is generally preferred for portability and decoupling from the host filesystem structure.
*   **Bind Mount (as configured here):** You specify an *exact path* on the host machine. The data lives directly in that host path.
    *   **Pros:** Easier to access/manipulate data directly from the host.
    *   **Cons:** Tied to a specific host path (less portable), potential host OS permission issues, can be slightly slower than Docker-managed volumes in some high I/O scenarios.

In this specific configuration, `nvPostGreSQL` acts as a *named reference* to a *bind mount* of the `D:\Docker_Shared\PostgreSQLDev` directory.

## Accessing Services

*   **PostgreSQL Database:**
    *   **Host:** `localhost` (or your Docker host IP)
    *   **Port:** `5432`
    *   **Username:** `postgres`
    *   **Password:** `postgres`
    *   You can connect using tools like `psql`, DBeaver, pgAdmin, or directly from the Adminer interface.
*   **Adminer Web UI:**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
    *   On the login screen:
        *   **System:** Select `PostgreSQL`
        *   **Server:** `postgresqldb` (This is the service name, Docker Compose networking allows containers in the same project to reach each other by their service name)
        *   **Username:** `postgres`
        *   **Password:** `postgres`
        *   **Database:** (Optional) Leave blank initially or enter `postgres` (the default database).

## Stopping the Services

To stop and remove the containers, network, and potentially the volume (though bind mounts are just host directories), run:

```bash
docker compose -f PostGreSQLWithNamedVol-Compose.yml down
```

*   `down`: Stops and removes containers, networks defined by the Compose file. By default, it does *not* remove named volumes. The data in the bind-mounted host directory (`D:\Docker_Shared\PostgreSQLDev`) will remain untouched.
